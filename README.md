This is a simple blog MVC monolithic application written in rust, divided into three layers:

- Model: Using [Diesel](https://diesel.rs/) as the ORM layer.
- View: Using [Tera](https://keats.github.io/tera/) as the template layer.
- Controller: Using [Actix](https://actix.rs/) as the API controller layer.
